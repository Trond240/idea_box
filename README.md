# Idea Box

## A project by 3 mod 1 students at Turing School of Software & Design

### Learning Goals

* Continue to improve on building responsive client-side applications with good user feedback
* Understand how to implement client-side data persistence using localStorage
* Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
* Utilize data-* attributes
* Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP

### OverView of Site

* The site is a useful tool for users who would like to log their ideas.

* Users will have two input feilds with the labels of title and body for creating the ideas.

* Once input feilds are filled out the user can click the save button which will creat an instance of an idea card.(multiple cards can be created)

* Once cards are created the user will have the option to either comment, star (favorite), or delte the card from the list completely.

* Future iterations will allow the user to show only starred ideas and the ability to search for spacific ideas that have been created.
