# Idea Box

## A project by 3 mod 1 students at Turing School of Software & Design

### Learning Goals

* Continue to improve on building responsive client-side applications with good user feedback
* Understand how to implement client-side data persistence using localStorage
* Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
* Utilize data-* attributes
* Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP

### OverView of Site

* The site is a useful tool for users who would like to log their ideas.

* Users will have two input feilds with the labels of title and body for creating the ideas.

* Once input feilds are filled out the user can click the save button which will creat an instance of an idea card.(multiple cards can be created)

* Once cards are created the user will have the option to either comment, star (favorite), or delete the card from the list completely.

* Changes made to the cards will be stored in local storage, and the change will persist through a page refresh.

* Future iterations will allow the user to show only starred ideas and the ability to search for specific ideas that have been created.

### The Comp Recreation 

### Technologies used

  * Atom
  * DEV Tools (including debugger)
  * Terminal

### Challenges

 
 * Grayson Palmer
  - I had some challenges when it came to navigating the event paths. I feel like I understand it a lot better now, and how to simplify/refactor paths to be shorter and more simplistic. Local Storage was another really challenging component, especially manipulating it and reading back those manipulations on load (re: favorite button).

  - I had some challeneges when it came to pulling items out of local link. Leaving this project I feel i have a stronger understanding of local link. Pulling items out and targeting them by id in order to starr or delte was very tricky.

### Wins!!!

 * Grayson Palmer
  - I think we really nailed the comp and making it look good at multiple screen sizes. Coming out the other side of Local Storage struggles was also a big win in my book. I also feel we didn't just get things functioning correctly, I feel we did so in a very dry and succinct way. We definitely leveraged roll up functions to try and make it so each function only handled a single piece of the puzzle.

  - Working with this team right off the back was a win for me. Also walking away with better skills with writing dry code and understaning how you can refactor was really helpful for my learning. I'm a very hands on learner and I felt I was able to contribute and be apart of the team.
